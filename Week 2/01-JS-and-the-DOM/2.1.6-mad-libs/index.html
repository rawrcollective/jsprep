<!--2.1.6 Exercise:
Exercise 3: Mad Libs!
1. Create a "Mad Libs" web page. It should tell a story, leaving empty <spans>'s with id attributes of 'noun1', 'adjective2', 'verb3', etc. Practice using the console along with `querySelector` and `textContent` to fill in the missing information one at a time.
2. After doing this manually, put these operations into a script tag, and use variables to store each word to be filled in before placing it into the web page, so that the template will be filled out automatically each time the page loads, but the information will be easy to change later.
3. Finally, prompt the visitor repeatedly to provide their own mad libs words. Save their responses as variables and then place those variables into the page to make a crazy story for them.-->
